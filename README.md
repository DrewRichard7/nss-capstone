# NSS DS8 Capstone Proposal - Andrew Richard

## Executive Summary

    - This project examines historical MLB data and builds a machine learning model to predict the World Series winner based on previous years’ team and player performance. Baseball is a sport rich in data, with decades of detailed statistics available. By leveraging this wealth of information, I aim to determine whether it’s possible to accurately predict the next World Series champion, and to identify which factors are most influential in making that prediction.

## Motivation

    - Previous NSS projects have used machine learning to analyze football and baseball data, but I want to take a deeper dive into baseball, a sport with a long history of statistical analysis and a vast amount of publicly available data.
    - The World Series is the ultimate prize in Major League Baseball, awarded to the team that wins the postseason tournament after a long regular season. Predicting the winner is a classic challenge in sports analytics.
    - Data will be collected from [Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/), which provides comprehensive team and player statistics for every MLB season.
    - As a baseball fan, I’m motivated by the opportunity to combine my interest in the sport with my passion for data science and predictive modeling.

## Data Questions

    - Which team is most likely to win the World Series based on regular season and historical performance data?
    - What statistics or features are most important in making accurate predictions about postseason success?

## Minimum Viable Product

    - The minimum viable product will be a machine learning model that takes in previous years’ MLB season data and outputs probabilities for each team’s chances of winning the World Series.

## Data Sources

    - [Baseball-Reference MLB Data](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/)

## Known Issues and Challenges

    - Web scraping can be challenging, but there are many resources available to help manage this process.
    - Not every team makes the postseason, and roster changes can impact team performance from year to year. I may need to account for these factors in my modeling.
    - Some teams may have limited postseason data, especially if they haven’t made the playoffs often. I may need to focus on regular season performance and engineer features that best capture a team’s championship potential.
